        "summary": "Summary: \n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has proposed a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that was added to a clearing-house eligibility file in August. However, this move does not imply any regulatory approval. The ETF is still under review by the regulatory authorities. The addition of the ETF to the eligibility file is a procedural step that allows the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to prepare for the potential launch of the product. The news comes amidst increasing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, with several other firms also filing for similar products. Further updates on the status of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF will be closely monitored."
