The cryptocurrency's value saw a 10% increase due to speculation that BlackRock had received approval for the ETF. However, these gains were short-lived as BlackRock clarified that their application is still under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The uncertainty surrounding the approval of the ETF led to a subsequent slide in Bitcoin's price. This event underscores the significant impact of ETF launches on cryptocurrency markets.\n"

      "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has proposed a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) which was added to a clearing-house eligibility file in August. However, this move does not necessarily indicate any regulatory approval. The ETF is still under review by the regulatory authorities. The addition to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) file simply means that the ETF has met certain operational requirements and is eligible for clearing and settlement through DTCC's systems. The launch of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock could potentially signal a significant shift in the acceptance of cryptocurrency by mainstream financial institutions. However, the regulatory landscape for such products remains uncertain.\n"
