    "summary": "Negative",
    "sentiment": "Summary:\n\nThe recent news of BlackRock Inc. potentially receiving approval to launch a spot ETF resulted in a 10% surge in Bitcoin's price, reaching $30,002 - the highest since March. However, this was based on an erroneous report, as BlackRock confirmed that its application is still under review. This incident provided an insight into the potential impact of the upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly invest in Bitcoin. \n\nThis event suggests that the launch of such ETFs could significantly influence the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets. It also highlights the importance of accurate information in the highly sensitive cryptocurrency market. The SEC's decision on Bitcoin ETFs is eagerly anticipated and could potentially open up new investment opportunities in the digital asset space."
